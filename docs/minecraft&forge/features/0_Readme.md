# Features - Readme

A **Feature** in Minecraft is something in the game world that could be considered a "logical collection of blocks".

The definition is vague because it can refer to a wide range of different things, from smaller features such as:
* Trees
* Chorus plants
* Fossils

However, there are large features as well, such as:
* "Mega" trees (the large variants)
* Strongholds
* Shipwrecks
* Villages
