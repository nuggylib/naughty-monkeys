# Adding tree Features

> Remember a "Feature" in Minecraft is a logical grouping of blocks that spawns together in-game; in short, a "tree
> feature" is simply a "tree" for the average (non-modder) player.

## No registering required

Because Minecraft already has a `TREE` feature registered, you simply re-use their built-in helper methods to create
custom trees.

You will, however, need to define the log placement logic, as well as the foliage placer.
