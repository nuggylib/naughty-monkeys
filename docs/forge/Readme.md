# Forge Readme

Since the Forge documentation is very lacking and often inaccurate, I feel it necessary to document relevant concepts
as we fight our way through them.

## Coremodding

Coremods are special types of mods that have the ability to modify every piece of code in vanilla minecraft. The creator
of Forge, LexManos, has this to say about coremods:
* 99.99% of mods don't need a coremod
* 99% of coremods should at least be attempted to be put into Forge
* 1% of coremods are actually doing something useful or that is wholly specific for their mods (and don't play well
  within the Forge ecosystem)
