# Java Info Readme

This directory is not a complete Java reference, but rather a record of Java-specific concepts, tips and syntax in order
to accomplish a variety of different things.

Each document for a concept should cover:
1. The base concept
2. When it was introduced
3. How was the problem it solved handled before it was released (e.g., "what does a lambda look like before lambdas existed?")
4. How the concept is useful for Minecraft modding

## Concepts
1. Lambda functions
2. Reflection
